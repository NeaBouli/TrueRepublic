Pnyx is a blockchain-based token for direct democracy.

The proxy-party is controlled by its members via an app and offers them direct political participation in a secure manner. The voting process is transparent and all activities are secured by blockchain-technology. At the same time, data protection is ensured, because all activities are stored without reference to underlying identity. Before every formal vote (in parliament), a pre-vote is performed by the party members. Representatives are required to follow the results of the pre-vote and also document their voting behavior. There is no overarching party program in which initiatives have to fit consistently. Therefore subsidiarity is maximized and each proposal stands for itself. The voters do notchoose the proxy party primarily because of their current programmatic goals, but for the fact that their opinion and voice have weight in the party.The proxy-party rewards the work of its members through mechanisms that are anchored in the blockchain network. The rewarding and inciting of participation is achieved through an internal currency. This currency is tradable on an exchange and the party uses a large portion of its income to buy it back from the users. As a consequence, a large part of the party's assets are managed transparently on the blockchain. The leitmotifs of the proxy-party are: security, transparency, dataprotection, equality, openness, subsidiarity, rewarded participation and simplicity.
