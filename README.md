Pnyx is a blockchain-based token for direct democracy.

From the Swarm-App to the Proxy-Party (draft)
Abstract
The proxy-party is controlled by its party rank via an app. It offers its members direct political
participation in a secure manner. The voting process is transparent and all activities are secured by
blockchain technology. At the same time, data protection is ensured, because all activities are stored
without reference to underlying identity. Before every formal vote, a pre-vote is performed by the party
members. Mandate holders are required to follow the pre-vote of the members and also document their
voting behavior. Subsidiarity is maximized, because each proposal stands for itself. There is no
overarching party program in which initiatives have to fit consistently.
The voters do not choose the
proxy party primarily because of their current programmatic goals, but for the fact that their opinion
and voice have weight in the party.
The proxy-party rewards the work of its members through mechanisms that are anchored in the
blockchain network. The rewarding and inciting of participation is achieved through an internal
currency. This currency is tradable on an exchange and the party uses a large portion of its income to
buy it back from the users. As a consequence, a large part of the party's assets are managed
transparently on the blockchain. The leitmotifs of the proxy-party are: security, transparency, data
protection, equality, openness, subsidiarity and rewarded participation, simplicity.
