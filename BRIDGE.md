GitHub recovery epic: [#4](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/issues/4)

## 2026-07-11 20:09 EEST GH-4 foundation merge audit → Review

- **Branch:** `fix/GH-4-recovery-foundation`
- **Issue:** [GH-4](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/issues/4)
- **PR:** [#9](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/pull/9)
- **Changed:** audit-only follow-up adds Docker build coverage, records the
  merge review, and removes whitespace-only diff errors
- **Tests:** Go build/test/race/vet → PASS; govulncheck fixable gate → PASS;
  Rust 26 tests/Clippy/audit → PASS with six allowed transitive warnings;
  maintained client lint/5 tests/build/audit → PASS; docs consistency → PASS
- **Risk:** Medium — dependency/toolchain foundation; no consensus or ledger
  implementation changes
- **Ready for:** refreshed GitHub CI and an independent GitHub approval

### Codex review feedback

Conditional approval for the recovery-foundation scope. The seven ledger and
token-economy blockers in `CODEX_AUDIT.md` remain explicitly out of scope and
must stay non-production until the ordered implementation PRs land. Do not
bypass the required independent GitHub approval.
