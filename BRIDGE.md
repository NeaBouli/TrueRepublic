## 2026-07-12 04:32 EEST GH-12 genesis and invariants → Local verification

- **Branch:** `fix/GH-12-genesis-invariants`
- **Issue:** [GH-12](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/issues/12)
- **PR:** [#19](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/pull/19) (stacked draft against GH-10)
- **Changed:** pre-mutation custom-genesis validation and exact module-bank
  reconciliation, provider LP export, non-empty round-trip preservation,
  every-block supply/escrow/reserve/LP crisis invariants, and repaired custom
  service/app startup wiring
- **Audit fixes:** rebased onto final PR #18; adapted LP export/invariants to
  collision-free keys; removed a publicly derivable bootstrap validator secret;
  bootstraps only from real CometBFT Ed25519 public keys with exact stake; made
  InitGenesis failures explicit; added four full-app divergence regressions
- **Tests:** Go build/vet, 615 cases, race, and coverage → PASS (root 66.1%,
  token 92.6%, treasury 97.0%, DEX 45.3%, governance 56.6%); Rust 26 tests/
  audit and maintained client install/lint/6 tests/build/audit → PASS
- **Risk:** Critical — InitChain, validator keys, canonical supply, module
  escrow, DEX reserves, and consensus-halting invariants
- **Ready for:** publication, refreshed GitHub CI/security, and independent
  review

### Codex review feedback

Conditional PASS for the ledger/genesis scope. The old default bootstrap would
have exposed a reproducible consensus private key; it is removed. GH-21 must
replace the still-invalid legacy `x/staking` gentx script with a PoD-aware real
validator-key flow before production node launch.

## 2026-07-12 03:34 EEST GH-10 DEX custody → Local verification

- **Branch:** `fix/GH-10-dex-custody`
- **Issue:** [GH-10](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/issues/10)
- **PR:** [#18](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/pull/18) (stacked draft against GH-13)
- **Changed:** bank-backed pool custody, atomic create/add/remove/swap
  settlement, provider-indexed LP ownership, governance authority for registry
  mutation, and canonical PNYX burns through `token.IssuanceService`
- **Audit fixes:** rebased onto final PR #17, retained both module burn
  permissions, replaced collision-prone textual LP prefixes with
  length-prefixed keys, and added rollback regressions for every custody flow
- **Tests:** Go build/vet, 578 cases, and race → PASS; Rust 26 tests/audit →
  PASS with six tracked transitive warnings; maintained client install/lint/6
  tests/build/audit → PASS; docs/module/diff consistency → PASS
- **Risk:** High — user funds, pool reserves, LP ownership, canonical supply,
  and chain-wide asset authorization
- **GitHub:** docs, DeepScan, Go build/vet/race/coverage, and the real Docker
  build pass on `3234741`; manual Security Scan run `29156922464` passes all
  five jobs
- **Ready for:** independent review; CodeRabbit is temporarily rate-limited
  and did not produce a substantive review

### Codex review feedback

Conditional PASS for GH-10. Every public DEX value transition now reconciles
bank custody, pool reserves, provider shares, and canonical burns before commit.
GH-12 custom-genesis reconciliation/runtime invariants still block production.

## 2026-07-11 20:09 EEST GH-4 foundation merge audit → Review

- **Branch:** `fix/GH-4-recovery-foundation`
- **Issue:** [GH-4](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/issues/4)
- **PR:** [#9](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/pull/9)
- **Changed:** audit-only follow-up adds Docker build coverage, records the
  merge review, and removes whitespace-only diff errors
- **Tests:** Go build/test/race/vet → PASS; govulncheck fixable gate → PASS;
  Rust 26 tests/Clippy/audit → PASS with six allowed transitive warnings;
  maintained client lint/5 tests/build/audit → PASS; docs consistency → PASS
- **Risk:** Medium — dependency/toolchain foundation; no consensus or ledger
  implementation changes
- **Ready for:** refreshed GitHub CI and an independent GitHub approval

### Codex review feedback

Conditional approval for the recovery-foundation scope. The seven ledger and
token-economy blockers in `CODEX_AUDIT.md` remain explicitly out of scope and
must stay non-production until the ordered implementation PRs land. Do not
bypass the required independent GitHub approval.

## 2026-07-11 22:08 EEST GH-14 escrow audit → Local verification

- **Branch:** `fix/GH-14-bank-escrow`
- **Issue:** [GH-14](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/issues/14)
- **PR:** [#16](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/pull/16)
- **Changed:** bank-backed domain/stake claims, atomic transfers, authenticated
  signer claims, signer-safe CosmWasm bindings, and real validator slash burns
- **Audit fixes:** closed a contract-message signer regression and prevented
  slashed PNYX from being recycled through admin-withdrawable domain treasury
- **Tests:** Go build/vet/race/coverage and 557 Go cases → PASS; Rust 26
  tests/Clippy/audit → PASS with six allowed transitive warnings; maintained
  client lint/6 tests/build/audit and docs consistency → PASS
- **Risk:** High — consensus-adjacent bank custody and validator accounting
- **Ready for:** force-push of the rebased stacked branch and refreshed GitHub
  CI/review

### Codex review feedback

The GH-14 custody boundary is locally coherent after remediation. Runtime
issuance, DEX custody, and custom-genesis invariants remain isolated in GH-13,
GH-10, and GH-12 and keep the repository non-production.

## 2026-07-11 21:25 EEST PR #9 review remediation → Verification

- **Branch:** `fix/GH-4-recovery-foundation`
- **Issue:** [GH-4](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/issues/4)
- **PR:** [#9](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/pull/9)
- **Changed:** hardened checkout credentials and workflow permissions, aligned
  canonical CosmJS CI with Node 22, updated current Go security dependencies,
  removed the hard-coded wasmvm module version, and synchronized public/bridge
  recovery status
- **Tests:** Go build/vet/race/coverage, govulncheck fixable gate, Rust
  tests/Clippy/audit, Node-22 client install/lint/tests/build/audit, docs,
  workflow hygiene, and dynamic wasmvm-path checks → PASS locally; refreshed
  GitHub CI pending for this remediation commit
- **Risk:** Medium — dependency and CI hardening, without consensus/ledger code
- **Ready for:** verification, thread-by-thread review responses, then the
  already-requested independent approval

### Codex review feedback

All 12 unresolved CodeRabbit threads were verified and mapped to six focused
remediation clusters. No administrative branch-protection bypass is permitted.

## 2026-07-11 20:54 EEST GH-4 wasmvm Docker linkage → Local verification

- **Branch:** `fix/GH-4-recovery-foundation`
- **Issue:** [GH-4](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/issues/4)
- **PR:** [#9](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/pull/9)
- **Changed:** replaced the Alpine/musl builder and runtime with Debian/glibc,
  copied the architecture-specific `libwasmvm` shared object into the runtime,
  and registered it with `ldconfig`
- **Tests:** reproduced GitHub musl/GLIBC linker failure twice; local Go build,
  docs consistency, workflow YAML, and diff checks → PASS; both corrected
  GitHub Docker builds → PASS
- **Risk:** Medium — node container build/runtime linkage
- **Ready for:** independent GitHub approval after review remediation checks

### Codex review feedback

The patch matches the glibc/wasmvm linkage already proven by GH-21 while keeping
GH-4's existing entrypoint and root data path unchanged. Both GitHub Docker
jobs now prove the corrected image builds.

## 2026-07-11 23:02 EEST GH-13 canonical reward issuance → GitHub verification

- **Branch:** `fix/GH-13-cap-issuance`
- **Issue:** [GH-13](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/issues/13)
- **PR:** [#17](https://github.com/NeaBouli/TrueRepublic/pull/17) (stacked draft against GH-14)
- **Changed:** canonical bank-supply issuance service, cap-clipped validator and
  domain inflation, supply-neutral treasury payouts, interval payout snapshots,
  centralized slash burns, atomic two-phase EndBlock reward settlement, and an
  architecture-safe/reproducible wasmvm node image with a reduced build context
- **Audit fixes:** rejected invalid canonical supply, closed the partial
  EndBlock commit boundary between staking issuance and domain issuance, and
  removed a duplicate Amino registration that panicked every CLI/node startup;
  final review also made bank-mock issuance rollback-aware and baselined restored
  domain payout snapshots
- **Tests:** Go build/vet, 569 cases, race, and coverage → PASS; token 93.5%,
  governance 55.8%; Rust 26 tests/Clippy/audit, client lint/6 tests/build/audit,
  documentation consistency, Dockerfile/YAML/diff checks → PASS. Both GitHub
  Docker builds, both Go jobs, DeepScan, docs, and the manual security workflow
  → PASS on the final remediation head; the complete security workflow also
  passes and all five review threads are resolved.
- **Risk:** High — canonical supply, mint/burn authority, reward inflation,
  validator power, and treasury claims
- **Ready for:** ordered stacked review after PRs #9, #15, and #16

### Codex review feedback

Conditional PASS for the GH-13 scope after the three audit hardenings. DEX
custody/burn integration, custom-genesis reconciliation, runtime invariants,
and anonymous recipient binding remain separately blocking.
