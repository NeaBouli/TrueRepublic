## What is TrueRepublic?

TrueRepublic is a platform for **direct democracy** and **digital self-determination**. Instead of electing representatives who vote on your behalf, you participate directly in decisions through **domains** -- community-governed spaces focused on specific topics.

The native token **PNYX** (named after the hill in Athens where citizens gathered to vote) powers the entire system:

- **Governance** -- Submit proposals, rate suggestions, elect admins
- **Treasury** -- Fund community initiatives and earn rewards
- **DEX** -- Trade PNYX against other tokens
- **Staking** -- Secure the network as a validator

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Domain** | A community governance space focused on a topic |
| **Issue** | A problem or topic raised within a domain |
| **Suggestion** | A proposed solution to an issue |
| **Stone** | A voting token placed on issues, suggestions, or members |
| **Systemic Consensing** | Rating system from -5 to +5 measuring resistance |
| **VoteToEarn** | Rewards earned by participating in governance |
| **PayToPut** | Fee paid to submit proposals (prevents spam) |
